      <u><p>What is MADMP?</p></u>
       <p>MADMP is a mini musical projector, it is able to clip onto any instrument and will display a set of notes to help you learn different songs to play. This tiny device is very useful for beginners and can help when just starting out. Learning new songs will come at ease by using the MADMP, with its projection of notes it helps you hit the right notes just by lighting it up.Thus resulting in you to remember which key notes to hit and you can continue learning even more songs.</p>
      
      <u><p>How is it useful?</p></u>
       <p>This projector is useful because it helps give a better understanding of what keys are what and the notes that are needed to be hit for each specific song.Starting off as a beginner can be tough sometimes because when I use to play the piano I had difficulty remembering each key and sometimes certain parts of a song will cause me trouble and I would get lost when playing together with the class. However with this product it will help you understand which notes to hit and lets say you have trouble with understanding what c is or e, you can have the projector read out the keys you play that way you can learn the sound of each key. All you have to do to activate voice control is by pressing the microphone button and it will instantly come on.</p>
